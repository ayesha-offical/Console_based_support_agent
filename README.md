# Console Support Agent System

A modular, console-based multi-agent support system built using the OpenAI Agents SDK and Google Gemini API.  
This project demonstrates how to create a scalable AI-powered customer support assistant that handles billing, technical, and general queries by dynamically routing requests to specialized agents.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:**  
  Includes a triage agent that classifies user queries and routes them to specialized billing, technical, or general support agents.

- **Context-Aware Tools:**  
  Each specialized agent uses dedicated tools with conditional logic based on user context (e.g., premium status, issue type).

- **Async Output Guardrails:**  
  Implements asynchronous guardrails to validate agent responses and prevent undesired outputs like apologies.

- **Console-Based Interface:**  
  Fully interactive CLI allowing users to input queries and receive AI-generated responses in real-time.

- **Gemini API Integration:**  
  Uses Google Gemini models through the OpenAI SDK for powerful, state-of-the-art language understanding and generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- An OpenAI-compatible API key for Gemini API (set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file)
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/console-support-agent-system.git
cd console-support-agent-system

Create a .env file with your API key:

env
Copy
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Run the application:

bash
Copy
python main.py
Usage
Enter your name and specify if you are a premium user.

Type your support queries related to billing, technical issues, or general questions.

The triage agent will route your query to the appropriate specialized agent.

To exit, type exit or quit.

Code Structure
main.py: Entry point; contains the CLI loop and agent orchestration logic.

Agents:

TriageAgent: Classifies queries and initiates handoffs.

BillingAgent: Handles billing and refund related requests.

TechnicalAgent: Handles technical support issues.

GeneralAgent: Handles general inquiries.

Tools: Functions decorated with @function_tool to perform specific tasks.

Guardrails: Async functions that validate agent outputs to maintain response quality.
